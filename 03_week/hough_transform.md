The **Hough Transform** is a technique used in computer vision for detecting shapes, such as lines, in an image. To understand how edge points in the image space are transformed to the Hough parameter space, let's go through the process step by step.

### 1. **Image Space:**
   In edge detection, the first step is often to identify edge points in the image, which are pixels where the intensity changes sharply (detected using methods like the **Canny edge detector**). These edge points are identified in **image space**, which is a 2D plane where each point is defined by coordinates $(x, y)$.

### 2. **Equation of a Line:**
   The goal of the Hough Transform is to find lines in the image, and lines can be described in **image space** using the equation:

   $
   y = mx + b
   $
   
   Here, $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the intercept. However, this representation becomes difficult for vertical lines (since $m$ becomes infinite), so instead, we use the **polar form** of a line:
   
   $
   \rho = x \cdot \cos(\theta) + y \cdot \sin(\theta)
   $
   
   In this equation:
   - $\rho$ is the **distance** from the origin to the closest point on the line.
   - $\theta$ is the **angle** of the perpendicular from the origin to the line.
   
   This form avoids the problem of infinite slopes and allows all lines, including vertical ones, to be represented in a uniform way.

### 3. **Hough Parameter Space:**
   - The parameters of the line are now $\rho$ and $\theta$, rather than $m$ and $b$.
   - **Hough parameter space** is a 2D space where each point represents a possible line. The coordinates in this space are $\rho$ and $\theta$.

### 4. **Transforming Edge Points to Hough Space:**
   For each **edge point** $(x, y)$ in the image space, we consider all the possible lines that could pass through this point. Each line corresponds to a specific $\rho$ and $\theta$ value.

   - For a given edge point $(x, y)$, you can vary $\theta$ from 0 to 180 degrees (or 360 depending on the setup) and compute the corresponding $\rho$ using the equation:

     $
     \rho = x \cdot \cos(\theta) + y \cdot \sin(\theta)
     $

   - Each pair $(\rho, \theta)$ corresponds to a line in the image space that passes through the point $(x, y)$.

   - As you vary $\theta$, you get multiple values of $\rho$, so for each point $(x, y)$, the possible lines form a sinusoidal curve in the Hough parameter space.

### 5. **Voting in Hough Space:**
   - In the Hough Transform, a 2D accumulator array (or voting grid) is created where the axes correspond to $\rho$ and $\theta$.
   - For each edge point $(x, y)$, all the possible $(\rho, \theta)$ pairs that define lines passing through that point are calculated, and a vote is added to the corresponding cell in the accumulator.
   - After processing all edge points, the accumulator will have **peaks** at cells corresponding to the most likely lines in the image. These peaks represent the $(\rho, \theta)$ values for the lines that best fit the edge points.

### 6. **Finding Lines:**
   - After voting, the **peaks** in the Hough space correspond to the most likely lines in the image space. These peaks indicate which combinations of $\rho$ and $\theta$ define the lines that are supported by multiple edge points.

### Summary of the Process:
1. Detect edge points in the image.
2. For each edge point $(x, y)$, compute the corresponding $(\rho, \theta)$ values for all possible lines that pass through that point.
3. Accumulate votes in the Hough parameter space.
4. Peaks in the Hough space represent the most likely lines in the image.

### Visualization Example:

- Suppose you have an edge point at $(x=10, y=20)$ in the image.
- For $\theta = 0^\circ$, you compute $\rho = 10 \cdot \cos(0) + 20 \cdot \sin(0) = 10$.
- For $\theta = 45^\circ$, you compute $\rho = 10 \cdot \cos(45^\circ) + 20 \cdot \sin(45^\circ)$.
- You repeat this for many values of $\theta$, plotting the corresponding $\rho$ in Hough space.

Each edge point in the image produces a sinusoidal curve in Hough space, and where multiple curves intersect corresponds to a line that many edge points support.

This is how edge points are transformed from image space to Hough space for line detection!
